## Overview:
For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, to create data visuualizatio to pitch to investor that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In our results we will show the following:
* the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
From reviewing the analysis, we can construe that many of the users are residents from NYC rather than tourist. Looking at various visualtion we see that the usage time of the bikes are during rush hour only on weekdays vs weekend. We also can infer from the analysis that the majority of the users are male subscribers vs females and customers. This information can be useful for marketing purpose. Another key data found is the avg trip duration time, becuase this is NYC data the avg was 5 minutes. For the most part everything in NYC is within close distance. For a bike sharing program in Des Moines it would be helpful to set up the station within 10 mins away. In suburbs locations tend to be more further apart.
